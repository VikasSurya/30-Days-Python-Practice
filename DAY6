1. Given a string S of lowercase alphabets, check if it is isogram or not. An Isogram is a string in which no letter occurs more than once.

Example 1:

Input:
S = machine
Output: 1
Explanation: machine is an isogram
as no letter has appeared twice. Hence
we print 1.

**********Solution**********
class Solution:
    
    #Function to check if a string is Isogram or not.
    def isIsogram(self,s):
        res = ""
        for i in s:
            if i not in res:
                res += i
            else:
                return False
        return True

2. Given a string s as input. Delete the characters at odd indices of the string. Return the final string after deletion of characters at odd indices.

Examples :

Input: s = "Geeks"
Output: "Ges" 
Explanation: Deleted "e" at index 1 and "k" at index 3.

*********Solution**********

class Solution:
    def delAlternate (ob, S):
        # code here 
        res =""
        for i in range(0,len(S)):
            if i%2==0:
                res += S[i]
            else:
                pass
                
                
        return res
