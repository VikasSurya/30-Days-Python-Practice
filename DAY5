1. Given an integer k and array arr. Your task is to return the position of the first occurrence of k in the given array and if element k is not present in the array then return -1.

Note: 1-based indexing is followed here.

Examples:

Input: k = 16 , arr = [9, 7, 16, 16, 4]
Output: 3
Explanation: The value 16 is found in the given array at positions 3 and 4, with position 3 being the first occurrence.

from typing import List

class Solution:
    def search(self, k: int, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        # code here
        res = -1
        for i in range(0,len(arr)):
            if k == arr[i]:
                return  i+1
        return res


2. Given an array arr[]. The task is to find the largest element and return it.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 8, 7, 56, 90]
Output: 90
Explanation: The largest element of the given array is 90.

class Solution:
    def largest(self, arr):
        # code here
        res = arr[0]
        
        for i in range(1,len(arr)):
            if arr[i]>res:
                res = arr[i]
        return res
